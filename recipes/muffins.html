  <h3>Delicious Banana Vegan Muffins (Sugar Free)</h3>
  <p>Packed with fiber and vitamins! These muffins are delicious in the morning shared with yogurt or even better just as a snack during the day! My mom gave me this recipe a year ago and ever since, I've had tons of compliments on them! Friends can never believe they are vegan and sugar free!</p>
  <p> They are very moist muffins so don't worry, they are supposed to be like this. Also, be sure to keep them in the fridge!

Of course you can replace nuts/raisins/chocolate chips with whatever you want. I once used sliced almonds. Very, very good! </p>

  <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 cup wheat bran</li>

  <li>¼ cup flax seeds</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
</ul>
